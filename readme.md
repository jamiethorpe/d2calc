# Update February 2021
This application was only created as a learning experience. With the announcement of Diablo 2 Resurrected, I'm planning on creating an entirely new application that will only be focused on being a great Diablo 2 skill calculator.

## About
I created this skill calculator to learn some new front end tools, challenge myself and to provide a calculator that works well on mobile devices.

### Tools & techniques I wanted to learn
* Vuex
* Vue Router
* Sprite maps
* Basic SVG

### Challenges
* Create one component to handle all character skill data
    * This was really not necessary, but I wanted to force myself to think as if I were developing this interface for a game that could have characters added in the future.
* Make it easy to use on mobile
* Both of these could still be handled better and need to be improved.

## Future Features
* Allow builds to be saved
* Display skill values per level
* Make the interface more user friendly
* Differentiate soft and hard skill points to allow synergies to be calculated properly
* Add + all skills to specific trees
