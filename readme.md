#D2 Skill Calc

##About
I created this skill calculator to learn some new front end tools, challenge myself and to provide a calculator that works well on mobile devices.

###Tools & techniques I wanted to learn
* Vuex
* Vue Router
* Sprite maps
* Basic SVG

###Challenges
* Create one component to handle all character skill data
    * This was really not necessary, but I wanted to force myself to think as if I were developing this interface for a game that could have characters added in the future.
* Make it easy to use on mobile
Both of these could still be handled better and need to be improved.

##Future Features
* Allow builds to be saved
* Display skill values per level
* Make the interface more user friendly
* Differentiate soft and hard skill points to allow synergies to be calculated properly
* Add + all skills to specific trees
